<br/><br/>
<h4>You are going to practice how to complain something to other people.</h4>
<h4>Pay attention to the example below.</h4>
<br/><br/>
<h4>Situation</h4>
<br/>
<p>One morning you went to a toy story to buy a toy car which had some lights in different colors that would be shining if it is put a battery in the battery space. But when you tried to operate it at home, the lights did not shine. You tried to put another battery but it still did not work. The car seemed to be broken</p>
<br/>
<h4>After knowing the situation, you have to make a dialogue based on the situation. For the example:</h4><br/>
<p><b>Ben   :</b> Excuse me.</p>
<p><b>Mr. John  :</b> Yes boy, what can I do for you?</p>
<p><b>Ben   :</b> I was who just bought this toy car here.</p>
<p><b>Mr. John  :</b> Yes, what happen?</p>
<p><b>Ben   :</b> I just came back to home then tried to operate this toy car.
But unfortunately the lights it has did not shine. I though it must be the battery I put in.
</p>
<p><b>Mr .John  :</b> Are you sure? Have you tried to use another battery?</p>
<p><b>Ben   :</b> Yes, I&rsquo;ve tried to change the battery but the lights did not work still. It      seemed the car is broken. So how is the solution? Will the car be repaired or you give me the new one? This is the receipt sir.</p>
<p><b>Mr. John  :</b> Yes I see, sorry for the problem. Here it is, I give you the new one.</p>
<p><b>Ben   :</b> Thank you sir.</p>
<p><b>Mr. John  :</b> You&rsquo;re welcome.</p>
<br/>
<h4>After making the dialogue, please practice it with your friend</h4>
