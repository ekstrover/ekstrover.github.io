<h4 class='text-center'>Trip to Bali </h4><br>
<p style="max-width:600px;margin:0 auto">Last holiday I had a vacation with my family. My father and I decided to go to Bali. We went to Bali by plane, but after I arrived in Bali we took the trip by car.
<br/><br/>We spent there for 6 days. We stayed at our resort during the trip. We visited many tourism spots. We visited Besakih Temple, Sanur and Kuta beaches. We also visited Tampaskiring and of course we never forget to go shopping in the most well known Shopping center in Bali, Joger. <br/><br/>That was a very marvelous trip I ever did, even after we went home we are so tired but its fun.</p>
