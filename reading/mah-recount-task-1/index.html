<h4 class='text-center'>Going to The Zoo</h4><br>
<p style="max-width:600px;margin:0 auto">Last New Year holiday Ika, Ida, Deni, and Eko went to the Zoo. They went there by motorcycles. They left their house at 08.00 a.m. and got there at 10.00 a.m. after parking their motorcycles, they went to the ticket window to buy tickets. They should show them to the guard before entering the zoo.<br><br>Firstly, they went to the cage of the dangerous animals. There were five cages. They are two for lions, two for leopards, and one for a panther. All of the animals looked strong and fierce. There was some meat in the lion&rsquo;s cage. It seemed that thee keeper had just given them food but they didn&rsquo;t eat it all.<br><br>After seeing the dangerous animals they went to the monkey&rsquo;s cage. There were a lot of monkeys in it. They were not afraid of visitors. Even they approach them as if they asked for something. Ika bought some peanuts to the food seller who walk around the cage and throw them to the monkeys. They caught the peanuts and ate them happily.<br><br>They walked around the zoo to see all animals. Ida took the picture of some animals. She took the picture of an elephant with Ika on its back. It looked dangerous but funny.<br><br>After walking around the zoo for two hours, they felt tired. Then they dropped in  the Javanese Food Restaurant to take a rest. They also have lunch there.<br><br>When the day was getting dark they went home. All of them felt happy and sattisfied.</p>
